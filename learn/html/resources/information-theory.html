Information Theory

Information theory studies the quantification, storage, and communication of information. It was originally proposed by Claude Shannon [1] in 1948 to find fundamental limits on signal processing and communication operations such as data compression, in a landmark paper entitled "A Mathematical Theory of Communication" [2].
