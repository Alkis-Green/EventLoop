<h1>Information Theory</h1>

<p>Information theory studies the quantification, storage, and communication of information. It was originally proposed by <a href="http://eventloop.gr/learn/html/resources/claude-shannon.html">Claude Shannon</a> in 1948 to find fundamental limits on signal processing and communication operations such as data compression, in a landmark paper entitled <a href="http://eventloop.gr/learn/html/resources/mathematical-theory-of-communication.html">"A Mathematical Theory of Communication"</a>.</p>
